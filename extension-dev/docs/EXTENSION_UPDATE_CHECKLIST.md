## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
Ensure the new API endpoints are deployed:
- [ ] `/api/extension/config`
- [ ] `/api/extension/tasks` 
- [ ] `/api/extension/monitor`
- [ ] `/api/extension/health`

### 2. Database Migration
Verify these tables exist:
- [ ] `tasks` table with proper schema
- [ ] `user_activities` table with proper schema
- [ ] Proper RLS policies for extension access

### 3. Extension Testing
- [ ] Load extension in developer mode
- [ ] Test login flow
- [ ] Verify configuration fetch
- [ ] Test task loading and setting
- [ ] Verify activity tracking
- [ ] Test health monitoring
- [ ] Check distraction detection

### 4. User Migration
For existing users:
- [ ] Notify about extension update
- [ ] Provide migration instructions
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with old endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for issues during transition

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Popup displays correctly
- [ ] Login flow works
- [ ] Configuration fetch succeeds
- [ ] Tasks load properly

### Activity Tracking
- [ ] Page visits are logged
- [ ] Mouse/keyboard activity tracked
- [ ] Idle state detection works
- [ ] Window focus changes tracked
- [ ] Distraction detection functions

### API Communication
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication headers included
- [ ] Error responses handled gracefully
- [ ] Health checks work
- [ ] Real-time updates function

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Works without internet connection
- [ ] Handles API errors gracefully
- [ ] Works with multiple tabs
- [ ] Functions across browser restarts
- [ ] Handles invalid tokens

## üìã Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Requires localhost:3000 for development
- Content script runs on all pages (performance consideration)
- Activity tracking throttled (may miss rapid events)

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Configurable API endpoint URLs
- [ ] More granular activity filtering
- [ ] Offline activity queuing
- [ ] Better productivity scoring algorithms
- [ ] Custom distraction keyword lists

## üîç Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Extension error logs
- [ ] API endpoint performance
- [ ] User activity data quality
- [ ] Health check success rates
- [ ] Task tracking accuracy

## üìû Support Information

If issues arise:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint connectivity
3. Test with health check endpoint
4. Review activity logging in dashboard
5. Check authentication token validity

## üéØ Success Metrics

Extension update is successful when:
- [ ] Users can authenticate successfully
- [ ] Tasks load and sync properly
- [ ] Activity tracking provides meaningful data
- [ ] Distraction detection is accurate
- [ ] System health monitoring works
- [ ] No critical errors in production
